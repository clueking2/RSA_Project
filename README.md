# START HERE
The RSA Project is a project from my class Discrete Structures. This project is about using RSA encryption to break codes and building thw tools needed to use RSA to encode and decode coded messages. 

The project is linked here: https://github.com/clueking2/RSA_Regression_Project/blob/main/RSA_Project.ipynb

### Contents
The project is divided into 10 sections:
1. Introduction
2. RSA Code Package
3. RSA More Code
4. DEMO
5. Code Exchange
6. Narrative on How RSA is Important
7. Why FME
8. How to Break Codes
9. Complete Examples of Code Breaking
10. Custom Code Feature
